## Notes on similar repo: SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium
See: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium

Note SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium project is more useful for building selenium grids while this one focuses on building disposable standalone seleniums with [video recording support](./docs/videos.md) and both browsers on the same container. It also adds some other features like [customizing the screen size](#screen-size) and [ssh access](#ssh) that can be particularly useful for tunneling support.

### Run

1. Pull the image and run the container

        docker pull elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

        docker run --rm -ti --name=grid -p 4444:24444 -p 5920:25900 \
            -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -e VNC_PASSWORD=hola elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

2. Wait until the grid starts properly before starting the tests _(Optional but recommended)_

        docker exec grid wait_all_done 30s

After this, Selenium should be up and running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`. Open the url in your browser to confirm it is running.
If you are using Mac (OSX) `localhost` won't work! Find out the correct IP through `boot2docker ip` or `docker-machine ip default`.

**Notes:**
 * Add `sudo` only if needed in your environment
 * Add `--privileged` or `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm` if you really need it. For example when [Chrome crashes](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium/issues/20) during your high gpu intensive tests.

#### Stop
Shutdown gracefully

    docker exec grid stop
    docker stop grid

### OSX
If you are in Mac, you need to get the correct IP of the docker machine. One of these two commands should work to get it:

    docker-machine ip default

or former:

    boot2docker ip

### SSH

You can also ssh into the machine as long as `SSH_AUTH_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"` is correct.

    docker run --rm -ti --name=grid -p=4444:24444 -p=5920:25900 -p=22222:22222 \
      -e SSHD=true \
      -e SSH_AUTH_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" \
      -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

Then

    ssh -p 22222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no application@localhost

Include `-X` in ssh command if you want to redirect the started GUI programs to your host, but for that you also need to pass `-e SSHD_X11FORWARDING=yes`

    docker run --rm -ti --name=grid -p=4444:24444 -p=5920:25900 -p=22222:22222 \
      -e SSHD=true -e SSHD_X11FORWARDING=yes \
      -e SSH_AUTH_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" \
      -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

Then

    ssh -X -p 22222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no application@localhost
    echo $DISPLAY #=> localhost:10.0

That's is useful for tunneling, or else you can stick with `docker exec` to get into the instance with a shell:

    docker exec -ti grid bash

Supervisor exposes an http server but is not enough to bind the ports via `docker run -p`, so in this case you need to FWD ports with `ssh -L`

    ssh -p 22222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -L localhost:29001:localhost:29001 application@localhost

### Screen size
You can set a custom screen size at docker run time by providing `SCREEN_WIDTH` and `SCREEN_HEIGHT` environment variables:

    docker pull elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

    docker run -d --name=grid -p 4444:24444 -p 5920:25900 \
      -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -e VNC_PASSWORD=hola \
      -e SCREEN_WIDTH=1920 -e SCREEN_HEIGHT=1480 \
      elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

    docker exec grid wait_all_done 10s

    open vnc://:hola@localhost:5920

### Chrome flavor

This feature was available in previous versions, please go to [2.47.1m] to use it.

To configure which Chrome flavor you want to use (stable, beta, unstable), just pass `-e CHROME_FLAVOR=beta` to `docker run`. Default is `stable`.

### Firefox version

This feature was available in previous versions, please go to [2.47.1m] to use it.
To configure which Firefox version to use, first check available versions in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md). Then pass `-e FIREFOX_VERSION=38.0.6` to `docker run`. Default is the latest number of the available list.

### Record Videos
Step by step guide at [docs/videos.md](./docs/videos.md)

If you create the container with `-e VIDEO=true` it will start recording a video through the vnc connection run upon start.
It is recommended to create first a local folder `videos` in your current directory, and mount the videos directory for
an easy transfer with `-v $(pwd)/videos:/videos`.

Once your tests are done you can either manually stop the recording via `docker exec grid /bin-utils/stop-video` where
*grid* is just the arbitrary container chosen name in `docker run` command. Or simply stop the container and that will stop the video recording automatically.

Relevant environment variables to customize it are:

    FFMPEG_FRAME_RATE=25
    VIDEO_FILE_NAME="test"
    VIDEO_FILE_EXTENSION=mkv
    FFMPEG_CODEC_ARGS=""

It is important to note that `ffmpeg` video recording takes an important amount of CPU usage, even more when a well compressed format like *mkv* is selected. You may want to delegate video recording through `vnc2swf-start.sh` to a separate server process and even delegate compression to a further step or to a cloud service like YouTube.

### VNC

When you don't specify a VNC password, a random one will be generated. That password can be seeing by grepping the logs:

    docker exec grid wait_all_done 30s
    #=> ... a VNC password was generated for you: ooGhai0aesaesh

You can connect to see what's happening

    open vnc://:ooGhai0aesaesh@localhost:5920

### noVNC

Disabled by default, [noVNC](https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC) provides a browser VNC client so you don't need to install a vnc viewer if you choose so. *Note:* we were using guacamole before.

Safari Browser already comes with a built-in vnc viewer so this feature is overkill and is disabled by default, just navigate to vnc://localhost:5920 in your Safari browser.

You need to pass the environment variable `-e NOVNC=true` in order to start the noVNC service and you will be able to open a browser at [localhost:6080](http://localhost:6080/vnc.html)

    docker run --rm -ti --name=grid -p 4444:24444 -p 5920:25900 \
      -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -p 6080:26080 -e NOVNC=true \
      elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

If the VNC password was randomly generated find out with

    docker exec grid wait_all_done 30s
    #=> ... a VNC password was generated for you: ooGhai0aesaesh

## Issues with Chrome

### Chrome crashed

If your tests crashes in Chrome you may need to increase shm size or simply start your container by sharing `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm`

    docker run ... -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm

Alternatively you can increase it inside the container:

1. start docker in privileged mode: `docker run --privileged`
2. increase shm size from default 64mb to something bigger:

```sh
docker exec grid sudo umount /dev/shm
docker exec grid sudo mount -t tmpfs -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=512M tmpfs /dev/shm
```

### Chrome not reachable or timeout after 60 secs
In CentOS and apparently since docker 1.10.0 is necessary to disable [sandbox mode](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox) through [--no-sandbox](http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#no-sandbox) example client implementation.

The error comes along with this message while starting Chrome:

> Failed to move to new namespace: PID namespaces supported. Network namespace supported, but failed: errno = Operation not permitted

#### No Sandbox

    ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
    options.addArguments("--no-sandbox");

In Protrator

    capabilities: {
      browserName: 'chrome',
      chromeOptions: {
        args: ['--no-sandbox'],
      },
    },

However this is now the default of this image, see `CHROME_ARGS="--no-sandbox"` in the Dockerfile so don't be surprised to see the "Stability and security will suffer" banner when opening Chrome inside the container.

## Security

Do **NOT** expose your selenium grid to the outside world (e.g. in AWS), because Selenium does not provide auth. Therefore, if the ports are not firewalled malicious users will use [your selenium grid as a bot net](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/147).

Put that firewall stuff aside, a file [scm-source.json](./scm-source.json) is included at the root directory of the generated image with information that helps to comply with auditing requirements to trace the creation of this docker image.

Note [scm-source.json](./scm-source.json) file will always be 1 commit outdated in the repo but will be correct inside the container.

This is how the file looks like:

```
cat scm-source.json #=> { "url": "https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium",
                          "revision": "8d2e03d8b4c45c72e0c73481d5141850d54122fe",
                          "author": "lgallucci",
                          "status": "" }
```

There are also additional steps you can take to ensure you're using the correct image:

### Option 1 - Check the Full Image Id

You can simply verify that image id is indeed the correct one.

    # e.g. full image id for tag 2.53.0h
    export IMGID="<<Please see CHANGELOG.md>>"
    if docker inspect -f='{{.Id}}' elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h |grep ${IMGID} &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Image ID tested ok"
    else
        echo "Image ID doesn't match"
    fi

### Option 2 - Use immutable image digests

Given docker.io currently allows to push the same tag image twice this represent a security concern but since docker >= 1.6.2 is possible to fetch the digest sha256 instead of the tag so you can be sure you're using the exact same docker image every time:

    # e.g. sha256 for tag 2.53.0h
    export SHA=<<Please see CHANGELOG.md>>
    docker pull elgalu/selenium@sha256:${SHA}

You can find all digests sha256 and image ids per tag in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) so as of now you just need to trust the sha256 in the CHANGELOG. Bullet proof is to fork this project and build the images yourself if security is a big concern.

## Cloud Testing Platforms

### Sauce Labs
To open the Sauce Labs tunnel while starting the docker container pass in the arguments `-e SAUCE_TUNNEL=true -e SAUCE_USER_NAME=leo -e SAUCE_API_KEY=secret` that will also require the tunnel to open successfully, else the container will exit so you can be sure your tunnel is up and running before starting to test.

### BrowserStack
To open the BrowserStack tunnel while starting the docker container pass in the arguments `-e BSTACK_TUNNEL=true -e BSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=secret` that will also require the tunnel to open successfully, else the container will exit so you can be sure your tunnel is up and running before starting to test.

## Additional Uses

### Using Xephyr to redirect X to the docker host
Note the below method gives full access to the docker container to the host machine.

Host machine, terminal 1:

    sudo apt-get install xserver-xephyr
    export XE_DISP_NUM=12 SCREEN_WIDTH=2000 SCREEN_HEIGHT=1500
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -resizeable \
        -screen ${SCREEN_WIDTH}x${SCREEN_HEIGHT} :${XE_DISP_NUM}

Host machine, terminal 2:

    docker run --rm --name=ch -p=4444:24444 \
      -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm \
      -e SCREEN_WIDTH -e SCREEN_HEIGHT -e XE_DISP_NUM \
      -v /tmp/.X11-unix/X${XE_DISP_NUM}:/tmp/.X11-unix/X${XE_DISP_NUM} \
      elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

Now when you run your tests instead of connecting. If docker run fails try `xhost +`

### Using free available ports and tunneling to emulate localhost testing
Let's say you need to expose 4 ports (3000, 2525, 4545, 4546) from your laptop but test on the remote docker selenium.
Enter tunneling.

```sh
# -- Common: Set some handy shortcuts.
# On development machine (target test localhost server)
SOPTS="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
TUNLOCOPTS="-v -N $SOPTS -L"
TUNREVOPTS="-v -N $SOPTS -R"
# port 0 means bind to a free available port
ANYPORT=0

# -- Option 1. docker run - Running docker locally
# Run a selenium instance binding to host random ports
REMOTE_DOCKER_SRV=localhost
CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -p=0.0.0.0:${ANYPORT}:22222 -p=0.0.0.0:${ANYPORT}:24444 \
    -p=0.0.0.0:${ANYPORT}:25900 -e SCREEN_HEIGHT=1110 -e VNC_PASSWORD=hola \
    -e SSH_AUTH_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

# -- Option 2.docker run- Running docker on remote docker server like in the cloud
# Useful if the docker server is running in the cloud. Establish free local ports
REMOTE_DOCKER_SRV=some.docker.server.com
ssh ${REMOTE_DOCKER_SRV} #get into the remote docker provider somehow
# Note in remote server I'm using authorized_keys instead of id_rsa.pub given
# it acts as a jump host so my public key is already on that server
CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -p=0.0.0.0:${ANYPORT}:22222 -e SCREEN_HEIGHT=1110 \
    -e VNC_PASSWORD=hola -e SSH_AUTH_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)" \
    elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

# -- Common: Wait for the container to start
./host-scripts/wait-docker-selenium.sh grid 7s
json_filter='{{(index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "22222/tcp") 0).HostPort}}'
SSHD_PORT=$(docker inspect -f='${json_filter}' $CONTAINER)
echo $SSHD_PORT #=> e.g. SSHD_PORT=32769

# -- Option 1. Obtain dynamic values like container IP and assigned free ports
json_filter='{{(index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "24444/tcp") 0).HostPort}}'
FREE_SELE_PORT=$(docker inspect -f='${json_filter}' $CONTAINER)
json_filter='{{(index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "25900/tcp") 0).HostPort}}'
FREE_VNC_PORT=$(docker inspect -f='${json_filter}' $CONTAINER)

# -- Option 2. Get some free ports in current local machine. Needs python.
# IMPORTANT: Go back to development machine
FREE_SELE_PORT=$(python -c 'import socket; s=socket.socket(); \
    s.bind(("", 0)); print(s.getsockname()[1]); s.close()')
FREE_VNC_PORT=$(python -c 'import socket; s=socket.socket(); \
    s.bind(("", 0)); print(s.getsockname()[1]); s.close()')
# -- Option 2. Tunneling selenium+vnc is necessary if using a remote docker

```

## Step by step build

### 1. Build this image

If you git clone this repo locally, i.e. cd into where the Dockerfile is, you can:

    docker build -t="elgalu/docker-selenium:local" .

If you prefer to download the final built image from docker you can pull it, personally I always prefer to build them manually except for the base images like Ubuntu 14.04.2:

    docker pull elgalu/selenium:2.53.0h

### 2. Use this image

#### e.g. Spawn a container for Chrome testing:

    CH=$(docker run --rm --name=CH -p=127.0.0.1::24444 -p=127.0.0.1::25900 \
        -v /e2e/uploads:/e2e/uploads elgalu/docker-selenium:local)

*Note:* `-v /e2e/uploads:/e2e/uploads` is optional in case you are testing browser uploads on your WebApp, you'll probably need to share a directory for this.

The `127.0.0.1::` part is to avoid binding to all network interfaces, most of the time you don't need to expose the docker container like that so just *localhost* for now.

I like to remove the containers after each e2e test with `--rm` since this docker container is not meant to preserve state, spawning a new one is less than 3 seconds. You need to think of your docker container as processes, not as running virtual machines in case you are familiar with vagrant.

A dynamic port will be bound to the container ones, i.e.

    # Obtain the selenium port you'll connect to:
    docker port $CH 4444
    #=> 127.0.0.1:49155

    # Obtain the VNC server port in case you want to look around
    docker port $CH 25900
    #=> 127.0.0.1:49160

In case you have RealVNC binary `vnc` in your path, you can always take a look, view only to avoid messing around your tests with an unintended mouse click or keyboard.

    ./bin/vncview.sh 127.0.0.1:49160

#### e.g. Spawn a container for Firefox testing:

This command line is the same as for Chrome, remember that the selenium running container is able to launch either Chrome or Firefox, the idea around having 2 separate containers, one for each browser is for convenience, plus avoid certain `:focus` issues your WebApp may encounter during e2e automation.

    FF=$(docker run --rm --name=ff -p=127.0.0.1::24444 -p=127.0.0.1::25900 \
        -v /e2e/uploads:/e2e/uploads elgalu/docker-selenium:local)

#### How to get docker internal IP through logs

    CONTAINER_IP=$(docker logs sele10 2>&1 | grep "Container docker internal IP: " | sed -e 's/.*IP: //' -e 's/<.*$//')
    echo ${CONTAINER_IP} #=> 172.17.0.34

#### Look around

    docker images
    #=>

    REPOSITORY               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
    elgalu/docker-selenium   local               eab41ff50f72        About an hour ago   931.1 MB
    ubuntu                   14.04.2             d0955f21bf24        4 weeks ago         188.3 MB

### DNS

#### How to share the host DNS

By default `docker run` sets the DNS to Google ones *8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4* however you may need to use your own.

First attempt is to use `--dns` option, e.g.

    docker run --dns=1.1.1.1 --dns=1.1.1.2 <args...>

However this may not work for you and simply want to share the same DNS name resolution than the docker host machine, in which case you should use `--net=host` along with `--pid=host`

    docker run --net=host --pid=host <args...>

So `--pid=host` is included to avoid https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5899 `sudo: unable to send audit message: Operation not permitted`

## Troubleshooting

All output is sent to stdout so it can be inspected by running:

``` bash
$ docker logs -f <container-id|container-name>
```

Powered by Supervisor, the container leaves many logs;

    /var/log/cont/selenium-hub-stderr.log
    /var/log/cont/selenium-hub-stdout.log

[2.47.1m]: https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium/releases/tag/2.47.1m
