# The purpose of this `docker-compose.yml` example is to run 1 hub, 1 chrome, 1 firefox
# i.e. this example doesn't scale, but there is another file for that: docker-compose-scales.yml
# i.e. this example doesn't support `docker-compose scale`
#
# If you try to scale this one you will get `Bind for 0.0.0.0:6080 failed: port is already allocated`
#
# Usage:
#  docker-compose -p grid up --force-recreate
